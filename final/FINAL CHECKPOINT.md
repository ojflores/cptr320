_Assignment:_ FINAL CHECKPOINT

_Date:_ 3-13-19

_Estimated: 9.5hr

_Actual Time: 17.5hr

BreakDown: 
    * 0.5hr each (1.5 total) planning, and deciding on custom endpoints

    * 0.75hr each (2.25 total) AWS instance created, Endpoints stubbed

    * ~3.5hr each (10.5 total) added CRUD and custom endpoints, front end some testing, completed version two (cp 3 requirements), succesfully                           implemented changes on the instance, instance functions fully

    * ~1hr each (3 total) presentation prep. 

    ** ~ 6.5hr -- I originally had a few of the simple test in the lumen documentation working (modified), I started adding to them and it broke. When I came back to it I had to delete the .vagrant file and now I can't get phpunit to work. I have followed every instructional I can find, but nothing is working, I destroyed and rebuilt vagrant again, and its giving a error about the CLI environment... This might be the problem... Im going to keep working on it and hopefully get it working.
