Our group has decided that the api we will be creating will be a basic intramural sports system for a university (tbd if it includes multiple sports, or if we are keeping it to just one)

Ideas for 2 resources with list and CRUD endpoints:
    - list,create,read,update,and delete teams
    - list,create,read,update,and delete players
    - list,create,read,update,and delete games

Ideas for 2 custom URIs (not basic CRUD ones):
    - schedule game(s)
    - player trades
    - view free agents (requires free agent status in db)
    - check in (players 'rsvp' to let the team know if they can make it)
