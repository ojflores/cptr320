# Lab 1: TODO Single-Page Application

In this lab you will be creating a TODO single-page application.

## Learning Outcomes

At the completion of this checkpoint:

* you will have implemented a single-page application.
* you will have used a REST API to create an application.
* you will be familiar with reading API documentation.
* you will be familiar with the basics of implementing a single-page application.

## Requirements

### API Documentation

The TODO API has been saved to **todo-2.0.0-swagger.yaml**.
Use the swagger.io site to view the API.

### API Implementation

Using a single-page application format, you will be creating a TODO list application that uses a REST api similar to your first lab.

The TODO list application must use the following endpoints.
The API allows you to create, search, list, modify, delete and activate/de-activate lists.

* CRUD operations on list.
  * Create new list                     Done
  * Read list                           Done
  * Update existing list
  * Delete existing list                Done
* Additional lists.
  * List TODO Lists
  * Activate list (extra credit)
  * De-activate list (extra credit)

For each TODO list, support adding tasks to the list.
These task can be created, searched, listed, removed, updated, and complete/in-complete.

* Support CRUD operations on tasks.
  * Create new task                     Done
  * Read task                           Done
  * Update existing task                
  * Delete existing task                Done
* Create support for these features.
  * List tasks for a specific list      Done
  * Complete task (extra credit)
  * In-complete task (extra credit)

Additional notes:

* Be sure to utilize appropriate HTML, CSS and JavaScript standards and validate your web application.
* Please add and remove data from the rest api, include your CS Username as part of the your web applicaiton.
* Before you begin the assignment, estimate the time you believe it will take you to complete the assignment.
    Then log your time and submit both your initial estimate and the final time that it took.

Because this assignment requires that you write HTML, CSS and JavaScript code you will need a browser to test before deploying on your public CS web server.
